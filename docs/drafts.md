# Draft

At most there is one draft for a survey. A draft is a revision of the survey that has not been released yet.
Drafts can be altered with the `Save Draft` action. Once a draft is considered ready to release, it can be published.
Alternatively a draft may be dismissed with the `Dismiss Draft` action. Users in the field will not be able to fill out "draft" forms.


# Update

A survey can be altered without incrementing its version when changing a label.
The update button will only be shown when there is no draft.
